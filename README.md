## Recommendation
If you want to replace feed dict operation with Tensorflow multi-thread and fifoqueue input pipeline, you can refer to my repo [TensorFlow-Input-Pipeline](https://github.com/zzw922cn/TensorFlow-Input-Pipeline) for more example codes. My own practices prove that fifoqueue input pipeline would improve the training speed in some time.

If you want to look the history of speech recognition, I have collected the significant papers since 1981 in the ASR field. You can read awesome paper list in my repo [awesome-speech-recognition-papers](https://github.com/zzw922cn/awesome-speech-recognition-papers), all download links of papers are provided. I will update it every week to add new papers, including speech recognition, speech synthesis and language modelling. I hope that we won't miss any important papers in speech domain.

All my public repos will be updated in future, thanks for your stars!

## Implementation Details

### Data preprocessing

#### TIMIT corpus

The original TIMIT database contains 6300 utterances, but we find the 'SA' audio files occurs many times, it will lead bad bias for our speech recognition system. Therefore, we removed the all 'SA' files from the original dataset and attain the new TIMIT dataset, which contains only 5040 utterances including 3696 standard training set and 1344 test set.

Automatic Speech Recognition transcribes a raw audio file into character sequences; the preprocessing stage converts a raw audio file into feature vectors of several frames. We first split each audio file into 20ms Hamming windows with an overlap of 10ms, and then calculate the 12 mel frequency ceptral coefficients, appending an energy variable to each frame. This results in a vector of length 13. We then calculate the delta coefficients and delta-delta coefficients, attaining a total of 39 coefficients for each frame. In other words, each audio file is split into frames using the Hamming windows function, and each frame is extracted to a feature vector of length 39 (to attain a feature vector of different length, modify the settings in the file [timit\_preprocess.py](https://github.com/zzw922cn/Automatic-Speech-Recognition/blob/master/src/feature/timit_preprocess.py).

In folder data/mfcc, each file is a feature matrix with size timeLength\*39 of one audio file; in folder data/label, each file is a label vector according to the mfcc file.

If you want to set your own data preprocessing, you can edit [calcmfcc.py](https://github.com/zzw922cn/Automatic-Speech-Recognition/blob/master/src/feature/calcmfcc.py) or [timit\_preprocess.py](https://github.com/zzw922cn/Automatic-Speech-Recognition/blob/master/src/feature/timit_preprocess.py).

The original TIMIT dataset contains 61 phonemes, we use 61 phonemes for training and evaluation, but when scoring, we mappd the 61 phonemes into 39 phonemes for better performance. We do this mapping according to the paper [Speaker-independent phone recognition using hidden Markov models](http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2768&context=compsci). The mapping details are as follows:

| Original Phoneme(s) | Mapped Phoneme |
| :------------------  | :-------------------: |
| iy | iy |
| ix, ih | ix |
| eh | eh |
| ae | ae |
| ax, ah, ax-h | ax |

#### LibriSpeech corpus

LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English speech. It can be downloaded from [here](http://www.openslr.org/12/)

In order to preprocess LibriSpeech data, download the dataset from the above mentioned link, extract it and run the following:
<pre>
cd feature/libri
python libri_preprocess.py -h 
usage: libri_preprocess [-h]
                        [-n {dev-clean,dev-other,test-clean,test-other,train-clean-100,train-clean-360,train-other-500}]
                        [-m {mfcc,fbank}] [--featlen FEATLEN] [-s]
                        [-wl WINLEN] [-ws WINSTEP]
                        path save

positional arguments:
  path                  Directory of LibriSpeech dataset
  save                  Directory where preprocessed arrays are to be saved

                        Name of the dataset
  -m {mfcc,fbank}, --mode {mfcc,fbank}
